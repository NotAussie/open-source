# The open-source alternative list ðŸ“¦ (Work in progress)
A **mega** list of OSS software to replace all those pesky SSPL dependencies along with all those closed-source hellholes.

## Redis

| Name ðŸ“› | Description ðŸ“‘ | 
| ---- | ---- |
| [Dragonfly DB](https://www.dragonflydb.io) | A powerful alternative built to be a drop-in replacement, no rewriting systems, just plug and play. |
| [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) | While not a drop-in replacement, Kafka and CouchDB can be a pretty good replacement for Redis's keystore system alongside their `pub`/`sub` messaging system. |
| [DiceDB](https://github.com/DiceDB/dice) | While still in its early stages, DiceDB is already shaping up to be a great Redis re-implementation. | 
| [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/) | While sadly not supporting Redis `7.0`, this fork seems to have a great future and is a perfect drop-in replacement for any application running Redis. |
| [Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached) | A powerful key-store cache that rivals in performance. |
| [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) | A speedy embeddable key-store database. |

## MongoDB

| Name ðŸ“› | Description ðŸ“‘ | 
| ---- | ---- |
| [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) | A powerful database built on the NoSQL style, sadly not a drop-in replacement, but it features super powerful tools and allows for more integration due to it using the `HTTP`/`HTTPS` protocol for communications. |
